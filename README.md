2. The brain sex continuum was calculated by the machine learning classifier trained through the UK Biobank dataset (The Human Brain Is Best Described as Being on a Female/Male Continuum: Evidence from a Neuroimaging Connectivity Study (Zhang et al. 2021, doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhaa408), code: https://github.com/zy-fdu/Brain-Gender-Continuum). cov_YMU is a variable in table format, containing covariates of subjects from YMU dataset. The covariates including age, sex, meanFD, diagnosis, HAM-D, etc.

Neuroimaging data were preprocessed through Weikang Gong's resting-state fMRI preprocessing pipeline (https://github.com/weikanggong/Resting-state-fMRI-preprocessing). The pipeline descripted in the Method section were used to preprocess the data.
